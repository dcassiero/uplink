							<h2>Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?</h2>
						</header>
						<p>You are a rookie detective whose job is to track down thieves that are stealing the world's most precious
							treasures.</p>
						<p>The Chase is On...</p>
						<p>Monday, 5 a.m. A ringing sound jars you awake. You grope for the phone and drop the receiver on the
							floor. Out of the darkness comes the voice, of the chief: "Wake up, kid. Got an assignment for you."</p>
						<p>You stumble out of bed, turn on the flight and grab your brand new detective's notebook.</p>
						<p>"Just got a call from Interpol, "says the chief. "Looks like Carmen's gang has pulled another caper."</p>
						<p>"Any leads?" you ask.</p>
						<p>"Not with this bunch. They're too slick. Can't give you any more details on the phone. Better get down
							to the office double quick. It's going to be a rough one."</p>
						<p>"Right, chief."</p>
						<p>As your trembling hand replaces the phone on its cradle, you wonder why you ever got into this line of
							work. Before this morning, Carmen Sandiego and her Villains' International League of Evil (or V.I.L.E.)
							were just sensational headlines in the newspaper. For more than five years, Carmen and her gang of
							felons had managed to stock pile the world's most valuable treasure, hwil outwitting every so-called
							"crime expert" from New York to Sydney. Now they've struck again. And you, the newest employee of
							the Acme Detective Agency, have been given the near impossible assignment of tracking them down.</p>
						<p>Good luck!</p>
