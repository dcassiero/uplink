							<h2>Isaac Asimov's Science Adventure</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Isaac Asimov: Science Adventure is a single player, multimedia educational title which contains a science quiz - however it's not as straightforward as that.The first things to say about this product is that it is NOT an encyclopaedia and it is NOT structured - at least not in a conventional way, this product is a series of small articles that can be accessed in a variety of ways that are intended to pique the player's curiosity.</p>
						<p>The screen is divided into four areas:</p>
						<p>Upper Left: This starts with a picture of the Earth from the Moon but for most of the time it's an map of the world which the player can spin, zoom in/out of, and click on to get some information relevant to that location, it's even possible to zoom right out to view the solar system.</p>
						<p>Upper Right: Here there are fourteen boxes each with a picture, most represent a branch of science. For example the first picture is an abacus so that must be mathematics - well maths is in there but you'll also find Stonehenge and other stuff; the next picture shows light going through prism and this takes us to the physics; the flasks of coloured liquid bring up something related to chemistry; the baby represents medicine; the cogs and gears are machines, the earth is geography and the picture of Saturn is space.
							Below these icons are the controls. The lifebelt is the in-game help; the U Turn sign goes back to the previous screen, the books represent the in-game library and the chess pieces start the game - more on that later</p>
						<p>Lower Left/Right: When a new article is selected the text appears in a window in the lower left and the associated picture appears in the lower right. Beneath the picture is a date and a timeline allowing players can use the timeline to scroll through articles chronologically</p>
						<p>The game has sound effects and can be played with the mouse or the keyboard.</p>
