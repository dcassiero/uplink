# Dockerfiles

This is a collection of Dockerfiles which are used for the uPLINK project. This can be simplifed, a TODO.

## Components

1. compose - a collection of docker-compose and rancher-compose files.
2. em_dosbox-base - the first stage for the individual em_dosbox-<game> image
3. games - individual Dockerfiles, per game. This can probably be greatly simplfied,.
